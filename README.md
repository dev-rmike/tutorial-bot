# Tutorial bot

Hey there! This is a simple discord.js bot for ER:LC servers. It has ER:LC and moderation features. It is fully commented to explain the code!

## How do I run the bot?

**1:**
Download the files as zip or click [here](https://github.com/dev-rmike/tutorial-bot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the latest version.

**2:**
Unzip the files and put them in a folder. For now I will use `/Users/mike/downloads/tutorial-bot`.

**3:**
Install node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/download

**4:**
Open your CMD and run the following command:

```
cd /Users/mike/downloads/tutorial-bot
```

Replace the filepath with the location of the unzipped file.

**5:**
You should be in the bot directory now. Before running the bot you must configure it. Open your file explorer and go to the bot folder. Open `.env.example` with your notepad and edit the variables. Close the notepad and rename the files from `.env.example` to `.env`.

**6:**
Go back to the CMD window and run the following commands.

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

Check your bot, it should be up and running.

## Customize the bot further

I recommend you to use a good code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Download it and run the installer. Open Visual Studio Code and open your bot directory. You will be able to edit the code & run the bot with a built-in terminal. Just press `CTRL + \`` and one will open in the bot directory. You can edit the file and the text.

All files have comments (Code that starts with //). The commands explain what the code does. Feel free to expiriment or ask my any questions!
